## Technical Implementation

### Body Type Determination
```python
def _determine_body_type(self):
    if self.gender.lower() == 'female':
        strength = self.hero_data.stats.get('Strength', 50)
        if strength > 80:
            return 'athletic_female'
        elif strength > 60:
            return 'fit_female'
        else:
            return 'slender_female'
    # Similar logic for male characters
```

### Sprite Generation
- **Female sprites** use elliptical shapes for curves
- **Male sprites** use rectangular shapes for angular features
- **Color coding** based on character themes
- **Proportional scaling** maintaining realistic ratios

### Combat Modifiers
- **Athletic/Muscular builds**: +10% attack damage, -10% damage taken
- **Gender-specific damage reactions** with appropriate messaging
- **Body type influences** on movement and combat effectiveness
